"""Turn the energy a run used into money."""

# Running a model locally costs electricity. gpu_monitor.py measures the energy a run used,
# which is the same wherever you live; this module multiplies it by an electricity price to get
# what it cost you. Energy and price are kept separate on purpose: saved results keep the energy,
# and the cost can be worked out again for any price, which is how local runs will be compared
# with paid cloud APIs.
