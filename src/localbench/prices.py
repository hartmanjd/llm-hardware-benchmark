"""Look up a local electricity price by zip code, state or country."""

# Electricity prices vary a lot from place to place, so a national average can be far off.
# This module finds the closest price localbench knows for where you are, from small tables
# shipped inside the package (built from public data by scripts/build_price_tables.py):
# your zip code first, then your state or country, then the US average. A price you type in
# yourself always wins. Whatever it picks comes back as an ElectricityPrice (cost.py) that
# says where it came from, so every cost can show what it's based on.

# The tables live in src/localbench/data/:
#   prices_us_zips.csv       zip, state, per_kwh  (NREL utility rates, brought up to date with EIA)
#   prices_us_states.csv     state, per_kwh, period  (EIA monthly state averages)
#   prices_countries.csv     country, per_kwh, currency, period  (Eurostat household prices)
