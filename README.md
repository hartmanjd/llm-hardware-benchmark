# localbench

Benchmark local LLMs on your own hardware, and find out which model, quantization and KV cache
setting runs best on your machine.

Each run measures:

| Metric | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Prefill tok/s | How fast the model reads your prompt |
| Decode tok/s | How fast it writes the answer |
| TTFT ms | Time to first token: the wait before the answer starts |
| Peak VRAM GB | GPU memory used at the busiest moment |
| Avg / peak W | GPU power draw |
| Energy Wh | Electricity the GPU used during the run |
| Cost | That energy times an electricity price |

## Data sources

Electricity cost uses the most local price localbench has: your zip code, then your state or
country, then the US average. A price per kWh that you give yourself always replaces these.
Each cost records which price it was based on.
