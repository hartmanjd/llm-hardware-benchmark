# localbench ships three small price tables (src/localbench/data/) so that nobody using it needs
# an internet connection or an API key to get a local electricity price. This script makes those
# tables from the original public data, and is re-run every few months to bring them up to date.
# Only people working on localbench run it; users only ever read the finished tables.
#
# Steps: download the raw files (or reuse ones already in raw-price-data/), boil each down to a
# price per kWh per place, and write the three tables.

# NREL only has the delivery part of the bill, so those zip codes fall back to their state
# average instead of looking far too cheap. Each rate is then scaled by how much its state's
# average has changed since NREL's year.
